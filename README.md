# Welcome to WIZnet’s site on GitHub 

WIZnet is recognized as the 'de facto standard' in the IoT space, offering TOE (TCP/IP Offload Engine) chips and iMCU products that enable various applications to leverage hardware-based TCP/IP. This delivers outstanding performance in terms of speed, security, and cost-effectiveness. WIZnet’s solutions are widely used in platforms such as Arduino's Ethernet Shield, various clones, and more recently, the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller.
